# Wroe_CSCI2270_FinalProject
    I created the game MasterMind.
    In this version, the computer will be the Codemaker and you will be the Decoder. The computer 
    will create a secret code of four colored nodes from a list of six: 
    1. Red 
    2. Blue 
    3. Yellow 
    4. Green 
    5. Purple 
    6. Cyan 
    For example, the Computer could create the code: "Red, Blue, Yellow, Red" 
    Hence, colors can be reused in the same sequence. After the computer creates a secret code, 
    you will then have 10 tries to guess the code. The computer will give you hints for every guess. 
    It will print the number of correctly colored nodes and the number of correctly colored nodes 
    in the correct position. Nodes can be the correct color but the sequence does matter so they 
    also need to be in the correct order.
    
    (Enter answer in the format: rrrr ; for red, red, red, red)
    
    In order to run the program, you will need to clone the repository to the computer. 
    Then, once you have cloned the repository, open the repository folder in the command prompt. 
    Once this is open run "g++ main.cpp Board.cpp". This should cause a lot of statements to pop-up, 
    but don't worry about it. Finally, run "./a.out". The program should be running.
